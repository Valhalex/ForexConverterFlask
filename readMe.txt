Hello and welcome! I have long been wanting to document the things I have
learned in my future projects. This app, was my first time working the Flask, and python.
This app was created to teach me about using web frameworks with python.
I am quite proud of how neat and simple my code is in this project while using the forex converter api.
Perhaps at some point I will come back to this and work on the design using CSS and a bit of adobe illustrator for the buttons. 
This project took about 9 hours to create the functionality with many more to debug it.
